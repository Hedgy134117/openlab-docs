Tried to print PLA on PETG. I wanted the supports to be translucent while the main model was opaque, hence them material choice. I don't really know why, but when picking up the print, all the supports printed just fine. However, the PLA just was not there. Not sure if it was my fault or if the two materials just don't mesh well together. The model was pretty big, took about 18 hours, so I don't want to run another test and waste more material.
