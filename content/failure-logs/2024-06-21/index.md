I think the fact that I don't have much to show for this week is the failure! I mostly worked in Unity getting a framework down for the steps project. Then, after having Wednesday off for Juneteenth, I came down with a cold. I couldn't get much of anything done on Thursday and Friday. Hopefully over the weekend I recover and am back into the swing of things next week!
