Struggled with the printer this week. Not sure what happened but every time I tried to run a print of a bunch of individual cubes (for the city steps project), it would just fail. Part of the problem with running a print and then heading out is that I can't check in on it and see if it's going well, it's up to the staff. And if my print goes wrong, and someone else is scheduled the next day, I have to wait until the next open slot.
