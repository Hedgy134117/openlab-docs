The more I use Blender on my personal laptop, the more I realize how resource intensive it is. Programming large scripts or scripts with lots of objects (which happens pretty quickly) tend to slow down my computer a bit. Using Blender + programming also uses lots of memory. My computer has 16GB, which is certainly capable for school, but not as much so for 3D models. I ended up talking to Dan, and I've started to use Legion laptops held in the lab, which are much more capable for this project!
