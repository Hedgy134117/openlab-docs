The main "failure" for this week was the struggle to find good software. On the first full day of work, with notes listed below, I tried a bunch of different programming languages, libraries, and other software. Each one has their pros and cons, but I ultimately ended up going with Blender as it was the most capable of both scripting and 3D printing. Important to note though that this wasn't really a bad thing, as now I know all these back ups and different software I can use if I need something more specialized/unique to one software.

## *Closing notes on 2024-05-23*

My day is coming to a close so I’ll go ahead and write some conclusions 
- This is a surprisingly niche concept, with not a lot of software out there 
- The brand “nervous system” is exactly the type of design I’m going for. They also do thing programmatically, but unfortunately, their software appears to be proprietary.
  - On one of their older posts, they mentioned the use of “openframeworks”. I attempted to use this, and while I was able to get it working with my own 3D shapes, I could not figure out how to export it to an STL or other file format for 3D printing 
- I looked into openSCAD, which is a good fallback, but they do not have a function for perlin noise, which is why I started to look for alternatives 
  - It’s certainly a good backup though, and it may be what I ultimately use 
- I looked into p5.fab.js, which appears promising, and uses a language I have used before, but it’s maintained by one person and requires total control over a printer, which I do not have (I want gcode!) 
- Ending off today, I started to look at scripting with Blender. I know that Blender can export to STL, and it seems to have a relatively robust scripting with Python, which I have more experience with over openframework’s C++. So, tomorrow’s goal will be to look more into Blender. 
- I may have to use one of the library’s computers since I know blender is pretty resource intensive, but we will see 
- I installed maybe a little too much software today, so I’ll need to clean my computer back up at some point 

Ultimately I don’t have much to show for today but there was a lot of “I tried this and it didn’t work”s!
