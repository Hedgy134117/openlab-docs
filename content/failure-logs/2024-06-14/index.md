Biggest failure for this week was the struggle to come up with a new idea. I spent a couple of days early on this week really trying to figure out what to do next. I messed around with my print from last week, trying to get it to work (such as using the resin printer, not super successful either). It wasn't until yesterday that I really hunkered down, found some good inspiration and a new dataset, and started working on another print.
